# iOS tools

These are useful tools to as quickly as possible implement parts of an iOS project. Some are implemented within previous XProject applications, some may be from other students IOT or software projects.

## Contents:
### Networking:
 Websocket.Swift - This file can be used to connect with other processes over wifi or on a localhost basis.
### ViewControllers:
 SettingsViewController.swift - This file is intended to operate alongside Settings.swift, but incorporates a standard list viewcontroller with headings and subheadings  
 
 LoginViewController.swift - This file is allows for a simple authentication pathway for two tiers of users. Priveleged users may enter a universal password to enter a priveleged portion of the app, otherwise users may select "player" to enter a standard privelege space. 
### Data Storage:
Settings.swift - This file incorporates use of iOS libraries NSCoding and NSObject to store data locally to the users device in an encrypted, easily expandable method. See example data structures for additional use (Bat.swift, Player.swift). Also provides additional data processing examples.

Bat.swift - This file is an example of what is necessary to organize and build a simple data structure that can be stored in the method prescribed in Settings.swift.

Player.swift - An additional data structure example like bat.swift
